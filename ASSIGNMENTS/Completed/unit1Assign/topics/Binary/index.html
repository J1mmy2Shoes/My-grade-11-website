			<p>
				Binary means "two states." The two states are sometimes called "1" and "0", or called "true" and "false", or called "on" and "off", (or other names.) The essential characteristic is that a single binary device can be in just one of two possible states.
				A bit is a single "on/off" value.
				A good example is a toggle switch, such as a light switch. You can turn it "on" or "off" but not (in normal operation) anything else. A light switch holds one bit of information.
			</p>
			<p>
				There are many advantages to binary. Here are four (somewhat overlapping) important reasons for using binary:
				Simple; easy to build.
				Unambiguous signals (hence noise immunity).
				Flawless copies can be made.
				Anything that can be represented with some sort of pattern can be represented with patterns of bits.

			<h2 style="color: #f9d342; text-decoration: underline;">Analog Signals</h2>
			<p>
				An analog signal may continuously change in value. Its values can be anything within a range of values, and its exact value at any time is important. The exact value at each time is part of the information it contains. Now say that you are observing the voltage of a wire. It has been agreed that any voltage below a threshold will be counted as an "off" signal, and that any value above the threshold will be counted as an "on" signal.

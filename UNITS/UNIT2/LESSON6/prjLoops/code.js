/*
Looping is a method by which programmers get code to be executed repeatedly.

There are 2 main types of loops.

1. Counted loop
2. Conditional loop

The formatt for a counted loop is as follows:

for(let index=initial value;index condition;index change)
	{
		body to execute repeatedly
	}

*/

for(let x=1;x<=50;x++)
	{
			alert("Hello " + x + " times");
			console.log("Hello " + x + " times");
			document.write("Hello " + x + " times");
			//break
	}

/* An execution of the body of a loop is called an iteration of that loop*/

for(let x=0;x=10;x+=4;)
{
	//3 iteration
} //last value of x is 12
for(let x=11;x>5;x-=5)
{
	//2 interation
} //last value of x is 1
